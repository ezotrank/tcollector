This Makefile allows you to package tcollector as an RPM and/or as an
EOS extension.  The plain RPM is for any Linux distro that uses RPM.

EOS is Arista's Extensible Operating System, the OS that runs on all
of Arista's switches.  EOS runs an unmodified Linux kernel along with
a Fedora userland.

Deploying tcollector as an EOS extension makes it easy to monitor all
your Arista devices.

To build the extension, just do `make all'.  Then install it like any
other extension, for example:
  copy http://www.example.com/tcollector-X.Y.Z-A.swix extension:
  extension tcollector-X.Y.Z-A.swix
Then restart the CLI.

Build custom rpm example
TSD_HOST=host.example.com ADD="collectors/0/elasticsearch.py" make

rpm -Uvh --force --nodeps tcollector-1.2.1-1.noarch.rpm
